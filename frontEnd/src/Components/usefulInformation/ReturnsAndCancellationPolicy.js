                        In the unlikely event that a product purchased from RKW develops a fault, you may need to return it to us in order to receive a refund or replacement. If this course of action is required, you will need to notify our Returns Department and follow the returns procedure in order to receive a credit.

                        HOW TO RETURN A FAULTY ITEM
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Items occasionally go faulty, and you may have to return these items to us for a refund. It is important that you notify the Returns Department rather than your Account Manager and follow the returns procedure in order to receive a credit.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you wish to return a faulty or damaged item to RKW, you will firstly need to request a RAN (Returns Authorisation Number). Under no circumstances should goods be returned without a RAN as the stock may be destroyed and no credit issued. Simply send your request via email to sales@rkwltd.com or fax 0333 220 6080 with the following information:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Model number and description of item</li>
                        <li>Detailed reason for return or detail of the fault</li>
                        <li>Your reference or debit note number</li>
                        <li>A contact name with phone number, fax or email details.</li>
                        <li>Uplift address</li>
                        <li>Invoice details</li>
                        <li>Number of cartons/pallets for return</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Please allow three working days for us to raise your RAN (this may vary during busy periods, generally between January and April). If you do not hear from us within a week, please contact the returns department in case your correspondence was not received.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once a request has been received, we will check all the items on your list against your account. The RAN we raise will show all items that we have authorised using the lowest invoice price (unless a specific invoice number has been provided for us to check against). If your returns request total is below £50, we will ask you to hold onto the stock until you have more returns totalling £50 or over (collections from Ireland must be over £100).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you do not have more returns after a period of time, you can contact the returns department to see if something can be arranged, or returns can be sent back to our returns warehouse via your own courier at your own cost. If you are returning stock yourselves, you must notify us of the date they will be returned and which courier is used.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have multiple pallets to return, we kindly request that you raise one debit note per pallet and clearly label the pallets with the relevant RAN numbers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If we encounter any problems with your request, we will query these with you. Uplift will not be arranged until all queries have been rectified.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        RANs will only be valid for 6 months from the date raised. After the 6 month period, we will delete the RAN and the return will have to be requested by you again. Please note that this may void any warranty that is valid on the item depending on the date of purchase if not returned within the warranty period.
                    </p>

                    <p className="subheading">
                        WARRANTY
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RKW provides a standard one year warranty across all products. Some products may have an extended warranty which would be covered by the manufacturer. The length of warranty is indicated in the product instruction manual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you initially request a RAN, we will check the date the item was last purchased. If it exceeds the warranty period we will request an electronic till receipt to show that the consumer is within their warranty. We will NOT accept hand written receipts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will make a note of any special instructions on your RAN, advising that any items that we have unauthorised should not be returned to us as credit will not be issued and the items destroyed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand that an item may remain unsold in your warehouse/store for some time and we will therefore accept the item back after the warranty period if the consumer receipt is provided.
                    </p>
                    <p className="subheading">
                        UNAUTHORISED ITEMS
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any unauthorised goods returned to us will be destroyed on receipt. If we find that items you want to return have not been purchased from RKW, these will be unauthorised and stated on the RAN. You must either provide an invoice number for the items or remove these from the collection. They will be destroyed if returned without authorisation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you receive any damaged items on your delivery, please state the full extent of the damage on the driver’s delivery note when signing for the goods. You must also inform our returns department in writing within 3 working days of delivery. Failure to do so may result in us refusing to issue a credit.
                    </p>

                    <p className="subheading">GOOD STOCK RETURNS</p>
                    <p>We do not routinely offer a Sale or Return policy unless you have an agreement in place with your Account Manager. All good stock return requests we receive will be passed to the Account Manager to authorise. We will not collect these until we receive the relevant authorisation from them.
                    </p>

                    <p className="subheading">UPLIFT</p>
                    <p>
                        We will send you a copy of the RAN detailing the methods of collection we will use. If uplift is required, you must contact us to arrange the collection once the stock is ready for return. We will not automatically book collections. If you have several cartons, we would send our nominated courier to collect. All cartons must be of a suitable size and weight for one person to pick up with ease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The driver may refuse the collections if the boxes are too big or heavy. Also, all parcels and pallets must be securely packaged and sealed before collection to prevent and items getting lost in transit. If you have pallets then we will use our transport department who aim to uplift within 14 days from the date the RAN was created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that the driver is signing for the number of cartons/pallets they are collecting. They do not sign for the contents you are returning. All stock will be checked and counted by our returns warehouse upon return. There will be notes on your credit note advising of any shortages once the stock has been checked.
